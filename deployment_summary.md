# Deployment Summary

## Overview

The InsureContent Pro platform has been successfully deployed to production and is now publicly accessible. The deployment includes both the React frontend and Flask backend integrated into a single full-stack application.

## Deployment Details

### Production URL
**Live Application**: https://ogh5izc6x58w.manus.space

The application is now live and accessible to users worldwide. The deployment includes:
- Complete React frontend with professional UI/UX
- Flask backend API with basic endpoints
- Static file serving for the React application
