# System Architecture and Project Plan

This document outlines the proposed system architecture and a high-level project plan for the AI-powered social media content generation platform for insurance agents.

## 1. System Architecture

The proposed architecture consists of a modern web stack designed for scalability, maintainability, and a rich user experience.

| Component             | Technology                                       | Rationale                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**          | React with Material UI                           | A popular and robust combination for building modern, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.                                      |
| **Backend**           | Python (Flask)                                   | A lightweight and versatile framework ideal for creating the RESTful API to power the application and integrate with OpenAI.         |
| **Database**          | PostgreSQL                                       | A powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. |
| **AI Content Engine** | OpenAI GPT-4                                     | State-of-the-art language model for generating high-quality, contextually relevant, and creative social media content.             |
| **Deployment**        | Docker, AWS (ECS, RDS, S3)                       | A containerized approach using Docker will ensure consistency across environments. AWS provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure. |
| **Payments**          | Stripe                                           | A developer-friendly platform with robust APIs for handling subscription billing and payments securely.                            |

## 2. High-Level Project Plan

The project will be executed in a phased approach to ensure a structured and iterative development process. The following table provides a preliminary timeline for each phase.

| Phase | Description                                       | Estimated Duration |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1     | System Architecture and Planning                  | 1-2 Days           |
| 2     | Market and Competitive Research                   | 3-5 Days           |
| 3     | UI/UX Design and Mockups                          | 1 Week             |
| 4     | Backend API and Database Development              | 2 Weeks            |
| 5     | AI Content Generation Integration                 | 1-2 Weeks          |
| 6     | Frontend Development                              | 3-4 Weeks          |
| 7     | Subscription and Payment Integration              | 1 Week             |
| 8     | Deployment and Infrastructure Setup               | 1 Week             |
| 9     | Documentation and User Guides                     | 1 Week             |
| 10    | Final Review and Handover                         | 1 Day              |

**Note:** This is a high-level estimate and may be subject to change based on the detailed requirements and complexity of each feature.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next step is to proceed with the **Market and Competitive Research** phase to gather insights that will inform the product's features and positioning. Following that, we will move into the **UI/UX Design** phase to create a visual representation of the application.
