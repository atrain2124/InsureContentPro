# Backend API Development Summary

## Overview

The backend API for the insurance content generation platform has been successfully developed using Flask. The API provides comprehensive functionality for agent authentication, content generation, and subscription management.

## Architecture

The backend follows a modular Flask blueprint architecture with the following components:

### Database Models (`src/models/insurance_models.py`)

**Agent Model**
- User authentication and profile management
- Subscription status tracking (trial, active, cancelled, expired)
- Insurance type preferences and default tone settings
- Trial period management (7-day free trial)

**ContentSchedule Model**
- Weekly content schedule management
- Links to specific agent and contains generation parameters
- Stores insurance types, tone, and additional prompting for each schedule

**SocialMediaPost Model**
- Individual social media posts within a schedule
- Contains post text, image descriptions, hashtags, and metadata
- Tracks insurance type focus and content themes

**APIUsage Model**
- Tracks OpenAI API usage for cost monitoring
- Records tokens used and estimated costs per request

### API Routes

**Authentication Routes (`/api/auth/`)**
- `POST /register` - Agent registration with email validation
- `POST /login` - Agent authentication with session management
- `POST /logout` - Session termination
- `GET /me` - Current agent information
- `PUT /update-profile` - Profile and preferences updates

**Content Routes (`/api/content/`)**
- `POST /generate-schedule` - AI-powered weekly content generation
- `GET /schedules` - List all agent's content schedules
- `GET /schedules/<id>` - Get specific schedule details
- `DELETE /schedules/<id>` - Delete content schedule
- `GET /current-week` - Get current week's schedule
- `GET /insurance-types` - Available insurance types
- `GET /tones` - Available tone options

## Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication with secure password hashing
- Role-based access control with subscription status validation
- Trial period management with automatic expiration

### AI Content Generation
- Integration with OpenAI GPT-4 for content creation
- Context-aware prompts including insurance types, tone, and seasonal relevance
- Structured JSON response parsing for consistent post format
- API usage tracking for cost management

### Data Validation
- Email format validation and password strength requirements
- Insurance type and tone validation against predefined enums
- Input sanitization and error handling

### Database Design
- SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Proper foreign key relationships and cascade deletes
- JSON field storage for flexible data structures (insurance types, hashtags)
- Automatic timestamp tracking for audit trails

## API Testing

The API has been tested and confirmed working:
- Insurance types endpoint returns proper JSON structure
- Tone options endpoint provides all available tones
- Flask application starts successfully on port 5000
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

## Security Features

- Password hashing using Werkzeug security utilities
- Session management with secure secret keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through ORM usage

## Dependencies

All required dependencies have been installed and documented in `requirements.txt`:
- Flask and Flask-CORS for web framework and cross-origin support
- SQLAlchemy for database ORM
- OpenAI for AI content generation
- Werkzeug for security utilities
- Additional supporting packages for HTTP requests and data validation

## Next Steps

The backend API is ready for frontend integration. The next phase will involve:
1. Building the React frontend dashboard
2. Implementing AI image generation for social media posts
3. Adding Stripe integration for subscription payments
4. Deploying the complete application

The API provides a solid foundation with proper authentication, content generation capabilities, and subscription management that aligns with the business requirements outlined in the initial planning phase.
